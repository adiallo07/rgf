1. All provided chess moves must be written in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).
2. The sequence of moves must accurately reflect a valid game progression up to the current position.
3. The next move must result in an immediate checkmate of the opponent's king.
4. The proposed move must comply with the official rules of chess, including correct piece movement and capturing mechanisms.
5. Only one move should be provided as the solution, representing the checkmating move.
6. The move must be legal in the given position and must not leave the player's own king in check.
7. If the checkmate involves special moves (such as castling, en passant, or pawn promotion), the notation must correctly represent these moves.
8. Disambiguation in SAN must be used correctly when multiple identical pieces can move to the same square (e.g., Nbd7).
9. The solution must demonstrate that no additional moves are required after the proposed move to achieve checkmate.
10. The performer is allowed to ask one clarifying question, but it cannot be a repetition of the original question.
